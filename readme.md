# Project for Web Programming class

For our project we have to build website(frontend + backend)

## Frontend

Frontend is build with HTML5 and CSS3 and Javascript(with noScript support).
I used many advantages of those technologies(HTML5 Canvas, ...).
Website is responsive(mobile first).

## Backed

Backed is build with Laravel 5.3 framework.
